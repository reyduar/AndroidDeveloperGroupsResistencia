What is Fon?
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
Fon is the world's first global WiFi network built by people like you. We think of it as crowdsourced WiFi.
</p>

<p>
As a member of the Fon community, you agree to share a little bit of your WiFi at home, and get free roaming at <a href="http://maps.fon.com/en">Fon Spots</a> worldwide in return. Sharing WiFi with Fon is safe and secure, and you won't even notice when others are connected because Fon only uses a portion of your bandwidth. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone with a broadband connection can join Fon. Just <a href="http://corp.fon.com/en/products">buy a Fonera</a> and connect it to your ADSL/broadband, or activate Fon through one of our partners. Once your Fon Spot has been connected and registered, you're ready to enjoy all the benefits Fon has to offer!.
</p>
<p>
Those who don't share their broadband through the Fon network can still connect to Fon Spots around the world by purchasing inexpensive <a href="https://fon.zendesk.com/entries/20101947-what-is-a-fon-access-pass">access passes</a>.
