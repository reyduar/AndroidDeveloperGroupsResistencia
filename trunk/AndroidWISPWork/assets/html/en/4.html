Fon takes your security seriously. Fon routers create two WiFi signals: a private, encrypted channel ("MyPlace") only accessible to the Fon Spot owner, and a second public channel ("FON_FREE_INTERNET") which other Fon users in the vicinity of the Fon Spot can use by signing in with their Fon username and password. All account details are encrypted during the login.
