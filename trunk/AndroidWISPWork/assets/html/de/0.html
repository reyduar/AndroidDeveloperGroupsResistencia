Fon is the world's first global WiFi network built by people like you. We think of it as crowdsourced WiFi.
</p>
<p>
As a member of the Fon community, you agree to share a little bit of your WiFi at home, and get free roaming at Fon Spots worldwide in return. Sharing WiFi with Fon is safe and secure, and you won't even notice when others are connected because Fon only uses a portion of your bandwidth.
