Fon Passes enable non-sharing members to access the Internet through Fon Spots. Fon Passes are available at all Fon Spots, so everyone can enjoy WiFi while out and about.
</p>
<p>
Fon passes provide consecutive minutes of connection once they are activated. Fon Passes will activate right after you purchase them, unless a previous Fon Pass is still active.
