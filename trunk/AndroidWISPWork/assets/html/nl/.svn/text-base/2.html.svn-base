Joining the Fon WiFi network is as simple as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying a Fonera router or checking if your ISP partners with Fon and has the Fon feature on your router (if that's the case, you just need to register for the service).
<li>Connecting the Fonera to your existing broadband internet service.
<li>Registering your Fonera and enjoying wireless roaming access throughout the Fon network for free.
</ul>
<p>
When you join Fon, you share a small portion of your broadband connection, and get free access to millions of other Fon Spots in return.
</p>
<p>
If you can't connect a Fonera to broadband, you can still enjoy access to Fon WiFi by buying Fon passes wherever you see the FON_FREE_INTERNET signal. Just create a Fon account and make your purchase by credit card or SMS.
