Can you imagine someone being true
Turn `round and put himself in front of you
Sometimes it's fun but then you never know
How far a thing like this might go

All my life I've waited for a chance to get right out of here
And when I had it in my hands I could not let it go

We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne

Try if you can to come where we have gone
You may achieve what can't be simply done
Look back and there you are where we have been
And still there's so much in between

All those years
I've travelled `round this world now I am standing here
To make you sing these tunes and know they'll never let you go

We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne


MR.Ego
Take me down
To a ground
Just let me feel it
If I let someone down
Please welcome
Him on the loosing side
I shake you off
And make my choice
Don't wanna hear you
Your slimy voice
Please go down, please
I don't wanna feel you around me

Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down

I feel that man
On my back
Don't promise any crap
Someone will break your neck
You don't know how
To soak my soul
Let me out
Let me go
Open your eyes
You told nothing but lies
Please go down, please
C'mon, go down with your ego

Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
Let me go ahead, let me go
